            Uagent Library
# Step 2: Set up .env file
        To run the demo, you need API keys from:
                OpenWeatherAPI
                
        #OpenWeatherAPI
              Visit OpenAI.
              Sign up or log in.
              Navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

# Step 3: Run the main script
          To run the project and its agents:
